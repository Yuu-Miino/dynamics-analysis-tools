# pp = Phase Portrait

This program computes the solution orbit of **a hybrid system**
which includes dynamical systems and a finite state machine.
The implemented method for numerical integration is RK4.

For the detection of the event, we have implemented Newton's method and the binary method.

# How to build
1. Download all files
2. Move to the **root** directory of source files
3. `make pp`
4. Then you get pp program in **bin** directory
